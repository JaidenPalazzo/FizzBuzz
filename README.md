# FizzBuzz


## What is this Project?

This project is an implementation fo the FIzzBuzz problem, a common programming exercise. 

The goal of the FizzBuzz program is to go through each number from 1 to 100 and chack: 
- if it is divisable by 3, if it is then it rints "Fizz" 
- if it is divisable by 5, if it is then it rints "Buzz" 
- if it is divisable by oth 3 and 5, if it is then it rints "FizzBuzz" 

For Example: 
- for number 1, it prints '1'
- for number 3, it ptints 'Fizz' (bc it is divisable by 3)
- for number 5, it ptints 'Buzz' (bc it is divisable by 5)
- for number 15, it ptints 'FizzBuzz' (bc it is divisable by 3 and 5)
